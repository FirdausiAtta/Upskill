What is the meaning of <meta charset="UTF-8">

A charset or character set is a bunch of codes supported by HTML. Any character we use in HTML
irrespecctive of what it is can be an alphabet, any special symbol or it can be any numeric values as each 
has a specific code so that the browser can interpret it and show us the output accordingly.

UTF-8 is the last update character encoding which came into existence. It comes with almost all the
characters and symbols in the world. Whenever we create an HTML document, the first thing to keep in mind
is the cad set. The meta set tag specifies the character set of this particular document. The browser will 
then understand and interpret accordingly.

In essence, UTF-8 is the foundation for ensuring your web page's characyers are displayed correctly,
regardless of the language or symbols employed, making it an essential aspect of modern web development.
